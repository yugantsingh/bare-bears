<p>                     
     When traveling as a stack, they usually form with Grizzly on top, Panda in the middle, and Ice Bear on the bottom, in accordance with their respective ages.
        
  
    Though it is unknown how they met, it is known that they have been together since very early childhood. The only known information about the bears before they met is that Grizzly was born in a forest in the U.S and was found perched on a tree by park rangers while in distress. He was afterward adopted by a TV Network to star in Family Troubles, a Canadian Sitcom; Panda was originally from Shanghai, China and raised in captivity until he escaped the facility; and Ice Bear came from the Russian Arctic and was raised by Yuri until he was forced to leave him on a floating iceberg after being chased off by hunters.

    he Bears are an adoptive family of three bears of separate species and are the face of the Cartoon Network original series We Bare Bears. The family includes the three main characters: Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear, each having their own personalities, interests and talents. They've been together ever since they were young cubs, as first revealed, unofficially, in the web comic The Three Bare Bears and the Pilot, and officially in the episode </p> <br>

        <h1> their brief story</h1>
        <p> 
          
     
     Ever since they met, they have been sticking together in the search of a new home. For a while, their home was a box on a road with "Free Bears" written on the side. In "The Road", their attachment to boxes seem to be rather strong and, after losing theirs, they attempt to find another box to replace it. Though they occasionally find places to stay that aren't boxes, they don't seem to travel very far without one.
          
    The three eventually found themselves lost at sewno food in an attempt to reach Japan. Eventually, a large wave crashes into them and washes them up into the shore of an island where they meet two castaways. They introduce themselves as Dave and Karla respectively. The Bears discover they've been trying to escape for a while but with no success.
          
   The following night, the three cubs explained to their new friends how they got stranded on the island in the first place. Eventually, Dave heads off to bed and Karla asks the Bears if they're ready to sleep. They manage to convince her to sing them a lullaby before they can sleep. She sings them a song she had sung with her sister all the time when they were children. This leads to the Bears falling asleep and Karla heading to bed  <div> <img src=" https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/53/93/8e539394614d8e15189724bddf121e6f.gif" alt=""></div>

     <p> Even as adults, the Bears found themselves homeless and strapped for cash. Though they had made many attempts in finding the perfect home for themselves after settling in San Francisco, Bay Area, none of them seemed to succeed. They eventually buy a home-made dream-catcher from a stand on the street and use it to try and dream up their perfect home.

     Soon after, a raccoon appears and snags their dream-catcher, running off with it. The Bears give chase in a desperate attempt to retrieve it. However, the raccoon outruns them.
            
     With it being cold, raining, and late, the Bears seek temporary shelter for the night. They soocome across an empty cave. There was a lot of bugs and creepy-crawlies in it and when Panda saw a centipede crawling on the wall, he became scared and hid behind Grizzly. Though they're not too fond of it, it's the closest thing to shelter they'd be able to get. They then rest up for the night.
            
     The following morning, they wake up to find themselves in what seems to be an entirely different place. Though still in the same cave, with the warm glows of the sunlight as is peeks from behind the horizon, the cave twinkles with utter beauty.
            
      The three proceed to start creating their own home; making holes for windows and creating a door; the basic necessities. After creating their new forever home, the three head outside and use Panda's old phone to take a photo of themselves in front of their new cave. The Bears have been living in this cave for over 5 years</p>

        <h1> about the three bears  </h1>
    <ol> 
       1.___ GRIZZLY -  Being a grizzly bear, he is familiar with the forest area the Bears live in. He is the leader of the three and is seen as such. He tries his best to do what's right for both the benefit of him and his family, but he can sometimes get carried away. Growing up without guardians, much like his brothers, he grew up trying to be a model big brother though his irresponsible and childish behavior often hinders him from doing a good job at it.<br> <div><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0HlIsgsnBCaI9KcE/giphy.gif " alt=""></div>

    2.____ PANDA : Panda seems to have more knowledge in things regarding technology and things from the Eastern world. He's the middle brother and, as stated by Grizzly, is "the link that holds them all together". He seems to be the most delicate of the trio, being both quite anxious and, as Grizzly also described, "cute". Even so, he does care about his brothers and will try to pitch in whenever he can.<br> <div><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/4d/00/c54d0043de88d0b77404b4714bb86d47.gif " alt=""> </div>
     3.____ICE BEAR : Ice Bear is the youngest of the trio but is undoubtedly the toughest of them. Being the most mature and responsible of them, he tends to do most of the chores of the cave, and he doesn't really mind doing so. Despite his willingness to pitch in where the others don't, he still takes days off to relax and unwind. Not only is he a smart and strong bear, he's essential to the Bears' brotherhood.<br>
